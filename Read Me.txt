Gooblem is a game Project made be Me and another Friend

My friend came up with the Idea of the game. He is responsible for the gameplay and
what changes he wants made.
He is also responsible for the artstyle. Everything you see while playing is made from
him including the Player, Map, and the User Interface.

I am responsible for coding everything. I made the code for the Player
and their attacks, World, and the User Interface. I am responsible for making sure
what he makes with art works in the game.
